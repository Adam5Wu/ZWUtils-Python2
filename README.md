# ZWUtils-Python2
This utility library provides basic run-time services, such as log management, configuration loading and saving, HTTP server & client, debugging support, etc. to Python 2.x applications.

It is a Python 2.x incarnation of the same principle in [ZWUtils-Java](https://github.com/Adam5Wu/ZWUtils-Java) -- simple to use and gets the job done, and **let your code be the master piece of your application**.
